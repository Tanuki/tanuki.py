# 🙈 Tanuki

The fastest and easiest way to build LLM features in python.

A *Tanuki Function* is a piece of code which replaces function stubs with LLM transformations at runtime, enabling you to drop in well-typed, production-ready capabilities into your app in seconds. No more prompt wrangling. No surprises. The more often you call the function, the faster it gets.

```
@tanuki.patch
def some_function(input: TypedInput) -> TypedOutput:
	"""
	This is where you include the description of how your function will be used.
	"""

@tanuki.align
def test_some_function(example_typed_input: TypedInput, 
					   example_typed_output: TypedOutput):
	
	assert similar_to(some_function(example_typed_input), example_typed_output)
	
```

## How it works

When you initially call a Tanuki Function during development, an LLM in a zero-shot configuration is invoked to generate the typed response. This response can be passed through to the rest of your app / stored in the DB / displayed to the user.

We register the input and outputs of the function during execution, ensuring that the outputs are correctly typed. 
As your data volume increases, we distil, deploy and manage smaller models that are able to capture the desired behaviour at a lower computational cost and lower latency. 

You can align the model to your use-case through *test-driven alignment*, in which you create tests which declare the desired behaviour of your function. 

## Examples

In this example, we define a simple classification function, and several alignment assertions which guide the desired behaviour of the function. 

```sentiment
@tanuki.patch
def classify_sentiment(msg: str) -> Optional[Literal['Good', 'Bad']]:
	"""
	Classifies a message from the user into Good, Bad or None.
	"""

@tanuki.align
def align_classify_sentiment():
	assert classify_sentiment("I love you") == 'Good'
	assert classify_sentiment("I hate you") == 'Bad'
	assert not classify_sentiment("Wednesdays are in the middle of the week")
```


```
@tanuki.patch
def score_sentiment(input: str) -> Annotated[int, Field(gt=0, lt=10)]:
	"""
	Scores the input between 0-10
	"""

@tanuki.align
def align_score_sentiment():
	"""Register several examples to align your function"""
	
	assert score_sentiment("I love you") == 10
	assert score_sentiment("I hate you") == 0
	assert score_sentiment("You're okay I guess") == 5

# This is a normal test that can be invoked 
def test_score_sentiment():
	"""We can test the function as normal using Pytest or Unittest"""
	assert score_sentiment("I like you") == 7
```

You can define standard Pydantic classes as your output, and can optionally add descriptions using _Field_ to help inform the purpose of each field.

```python
@dataclass
class ActionItem:
    goal: str = Field(description="What task must be completed")
    deadline: datetime = Field(description="The date the goal needs to be achieved")
    
@tanuki.patch
def action_items(input: str) -> List[ActionItem]:
	"""Generate a list of Action Items"""

@tanuki.align
def align_action_items():
	goal = "Can you please get the presentation to me by Tuesday?"
	next_tuesday = (datetime.now() + timedelta((1 - datetime.now().weekday() + 7) % 7)).replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
	
	assert action_items(goal) == ActionItem(goal="Prepare the presentation", deadline=next_tuesday)
```

## Test-Driven Alignment

To align the behaviour of your patched function to your needs, decorate a function with `@align`.

```python
def test_score_sentiment():
	"""We can test the function as normal using Pytest or Unittest"""
	assert score_sentiment("I like you") == 7
```

You assert the behaviour of your patched function either declaring the desired output through equality or inequality checking, or the downstream behaviour of consequent functions:


(HOW CAN WE ACHIEVE THIS?)
```python
def test_score_sentiment():
	"""We can test the function as normal using Pytest or Unittest"""
	assert multiply_by_two(score_sentiment("I like you")) == 14
	assert 2*score_sentiment("I like you") == 14
```




## Simple ToDo List App

```
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Optional, List
from pydantic import Field
from fastapi import FastAPI
import munk

app = FastAPI()

@dataclass
class TodoItem:
    goal: str = Field(description="What task must be completed")
    deadline: datetime = Field(description="The date the goal needs to be achieved")
    priority: str = Field(description="Priority level of the task")
    people_involved: List[str] = Field(description="Names of people involved")


@tanuki.func
def generate_todo(input: str) -> TodoItem:
    """
    Generate a TodoItem based on the natural language input.
    """

@tanuki.align
def align_generate_todo():
    next_tuesday = (datetime.now() + timedelta((1 - datetime.now().weekday() + 7) % 7)).replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
    next_friday = (datetime.now() + timedelta((4 - datetime.now().weekday() + 7) % 7)).replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)

    # First example
    assert generate_todo("Prepare the presentation for John by next Tuesday, high priority") == TodoItem(
        goal="Prepare the presentation",
        deadline=next_tuesday,
        priority="high",
        people_involved=["John"]
    )

    # Second example: Different priority and deadline
    assert generate_todo("Complete the report by Friday, medium priority") == TodoItem(
        goal="Complete the report",
        deadline=next_friday,
        priority="medium",
        people_involved=[]
    )

    # Third example: Multiple people involved
    assert generate_todo("Organize the team meeting with Emily and Sarah for next Tuesday") == TodoItem(
        goal="Organize the team meeting",
        deadline=next_tuesday,
        priority="",
        people_involved=["Emily", "Sarah"]
    )

    # Fourth example: No deadline
    assert generate_todo("Buy groceries, low priority") == TodoItem(
        goal="Buy groceries",
        deadline=None,
        priority="low",
        people_involved=[]
    )

    # Fifth example: No priority or people involved
    assert generate_todo("Read the new book") == TodoItem(
        goal="Read the new book",
        deadline=None,
        priority="",
        people_involved=[]
    )

@app.post("/todo/", response_model=TodoItem)
async def create_todo(input: str):
    return generate_todo(input)
